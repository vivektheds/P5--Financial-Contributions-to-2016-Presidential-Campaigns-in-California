# Abstract:
In 2016 United State presidential election Donald Trump J. became 45th president of US. There were many factors which contributed in winning US presidential election and  Financial contribution from US contributors was one of the factor which impacted that election outcome.  
In this project, I am going to investigate the financial factor that could potentially contribute to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election campaign, and for this exploratory data analysis I chose California state data because I live here and second reason is that Donald Trump lost in California despite of winning US president election,.
so I am interested in doing  research demographics and geographical distribution of contributors/donors  for each party and each candidate and find out the trends of the campaign, and at the end my research will be focused on two primarily rivals Donald Trump J. and Hillary Clinton.

For this research I got the financial data from [FEC site]( https://classic.fec.gov/disclosurep/pnational.do). This dataset contains financial contribution transaction from 05-Nov-2013 to 31-Dec-2016, and using California dataset I will try to answer below questions:

1- Which candidate and party did receive the most support in California in terms of money and no of supporters.
2- What do these contributors do and how does contributors'  occupation and gender impact the contribution towards a particular candidate and a party and are there any pattern in that.
3- Where do these donations come from geographically?
4- Also I am interested in contribution pattern over course of election campaign and how it is varying when election was approaching.

As per the above graph we can see that retired people has contributed most in US presidential campaign and followed by "Not Employed"" who can be freelancers, after that significant no of people from  "Attorney", "INFORMATION REQUESTED" and "TEACHER" professions are actively contributing.
However it is strange that retired and not employed people have contributed most instead of emmployed and high paid professionals. 


# Univariate Analysis


### What is the structure of your dataset?

> There are 1304346 financial contribution transactions for different president candidates in the dataset with 17 features such as cand_nm,contbr_nm,contbr_city, contbr_zip, contbr_occupation etc.

> Other observations:
- Some contribution amounts were negative which we have removed from the dataset.
- Median contribution amount is $27.
- As per summary 75% contributors contributed upto $99. 
- More no of females were contributing in US presidential financial campaign.
- Most no of people who contributed are retired peole.

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

> The main feature is contb_receipt_amt and I want to do analysis on contb_receipt_amt distribution using it's summary with other variables to find out the patterns if any.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

> I think that cand_nm,contbr_nm,contbr_city, contbr_zip, contbr_occupation and contb_receipt_dt columns can help us to understand the patterns in 2016 US presidential election campaign.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

> I have created six new variables first_nm, last_nm, gender, party, longitude and latitude to find out the most relevant factors which impacted most in 2016 US presidential election.

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

> I found some negative contributing amount which was unusal hence I have removed those transactions from the final data which I have used for analysis.
I square root transformed the right skewed contribution amount, and after that transformation we were able to better visualize amount distribution and it seems most of the contributers are contributing less amount of money which is around less than $100.

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

> Most of the total contribution in California went to the Democratic party which is almost 3 times more than republican party.
- Within each party, the majority of contributions were received by top contenders.
- For Democratic party 99% of contributing amount received in California goes to Hillary Clinton and Bernard Sanders, and of which 81.69% goes to Hillary Clinton.

> As per the above time series graph of contribution received by top 5 candidates in California we can say that from 2014 the start of the US presidential financial campaign till eight months before the election Bernard Sanders's contribution amount received was appraching to Hillary Clinton's contribution amount and other candidates were also getting decent contribution from California people and surprisingly Trump received least amount among  these five candidates.
However, in the last 8 months of campaign only Hillary clinton was getting a beyond financial suport from California people and one more very surprise thing was that Trump was started getting very significant amount of contribution in california which was giving positive sentiments towards Trump though Hillary Clinton was most favorite.


# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

> Majority of contribution came from top five major cities of California.
- Hillary Clinton was dominating all time during Financial Campagin as far as contributing amount is concerned.
- While closer to election, Hillary Clinton started getting a beyond financial support in California.
- While closer to the election,surprisingly Trump also started getting very good support in California however not as much as Hillary Clinton.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

> For a certain period of time, Bernard Sanders received more donations and gained more popularity than Hillary Clinton.


------

# Final Plots and Summary

### Most Contribution went to a few candidates

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}

ggplot(Funding_By_party_cand_nm, aes(cand_nm, Total_Amount,fill=party)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity") +
         theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
        #geom_text(aes(label=Total_Amount), vjust=-0.3, size=3.5) +
        #geom_text(aes(label=Total_Amount), vjust=1.6, color="black", size=3.5) +
        #theme_minimal() +
        ggtitle('Contribution Amount Received by Candidates from Their Own Party') +
        scale_fill_manual(values=c("#41b8f4", "#ff7777")) +
        scale_y_continuous(name="Total Amount Received", labels = scales::comma)


```

> In Califoria democratic party received a way more contributing amount than republican party,and within democratic party Hillary Clinton received highest funding in California which is around $95 Million and that is more than 4 times funding received by any other candidates.
Moreover, majority of contribution is concentrated on top contenders within each party ,and Bernard Sanders (democratic) and Donald Trump(republican) have received 20 Million and 14 Million respectively which were a way less than amount received by Hillary Clinton, so they were second and third popular candidate in California.
For republican party Rafael Ted Cruz and Rubio Marco were two other top contenders as far as republican contributing amount is concerned.
 


### Female contributed less than male however female contributed more to female candidate:

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}

Funding_By_Gender_cand_nm <- Funding_By_Gender_party_cand_nm %>% 
      filter(cand_nm %in% c("Clinton, Hillary Rodham", "Sanders, Bernard" ,"Trump, Donald J.","Rubio, Marco" ,"Cruz, Rafael Edward 'Ted'" ))

ggplot(Funding_By_Gender_cand_nm, aes(cand_nm, Total_Amount,fill=gender)) +
        geom_bar(stat="identity", position = position_dodge()) +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
        #geom_text(stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge(0.9),aes(label=Total_Amount), vjust=-0.3, color="black", size=3.0) +
       # theme_minimal() + 
        xlab("Candidates") +
         scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
        ggtitle('Contribution Amount Received by Gender and Candidates') +
        scale_y_continuous(name="Total Amount Received", labels = scales::comma)

```

> In California male has contributed more money than female, and as per previous analysis female has contributed more to democratic party and from the above graph of top five candidates we can say that female contributors dominantly contributed to Hillary Clinton, and it gives us clear pattern that female are highly inclined to contribute to female candidate and on the other hand male are contributing more to male candidates. 


### Contribution by Occupation

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}

plot_profession <- ggplot(occupation_party_df, aes(contbr_occupation, count, fill=party))
plot_profession <- plot_profession + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = 'dodge') +
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
        scale_fill_manual(values=c("#41b8f4", "#ff7777")) +
        xlab("Occupations")+
        ylab("No of Contributors") +
        ggtitle("Contribution for each party by Top 10 Professions")
plot_profession

```

> Across all top 10 occupations democratic party got majority contribution which is far more than republican party.
Most of Retired people contributed to Democratic party however surprisingly all Not employed people who belongs to second highest contributor's profession had contributed to Democratic party only.


------

# Reflection

### Struggles:
> The 2016 presidential campaign contributions dataset for California state contains over 289901 observations.
While analyzing this dataset I came across multiple challenges and issues.
 - The original dataset didn't has gender information and in order to analyze contribution by gender I have used 'gender' R package to derive gender from the first name of contributors.
 - For geographical analysis longitude and latitude were require however the original dataset had only zipcode of contributor, so I had used 'zipcode' R package to derive these two attributes from zipcode, and I have used ggmap to analyze contributors by location.
 - I was not thoroughly aware of US presidential election process, so before doing any analysis I had to spent some time to acquire this fundamental knowledge so that my analysis should not be biased.

### Conclusion:
> After analyzing California financial contribution data I came across many interesting findings and patterns.
- Democratic party received more contribution than republican party.
- The Majority of contribution was received by top contenders.
- Female contributors contributed more to Democratic party and female candidate.
- Female made maximum contribution to Hillary Clinton.
- Retired people contributed more to Democratic party however surprisingly Not employed people had contributed to only Democratic party. 
- Majority of contribution came from top five major cities of California.
- For a certain period of time, Bernard Sanders received more contribution and gained more popularity than Hillary Clinton.


### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

> Majority of Retired people contributed to Democratic party however surprisingly all Not employed people who belongs to second highest contributor's profession had contributed to Democratic party only.



### Future Work:
> I analyzed 2016 US presidential financial campaign data for California state and came across some popular president contenders and their finding in California however it would be very interesting to analyze other states financial campaign data as well as nationwide data so that we can predict accurately which candidate and party had very good chance of winning the president election based on financial campaign across US.
