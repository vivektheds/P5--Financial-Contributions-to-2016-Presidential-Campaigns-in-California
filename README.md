In 2016 United State presidential election Donald Trump J. became 45th president of US. There were many factors which contributed in winning US presidential election and Financial contribution from US contributors was one of the factor which impacted that election outcome.
In this project, I am going to investigate the financial factor that could potentially contribute to the outcome of the 2016 presidential election campaign, and for this exploratory data analysis I chose California state data because I live here and second reason is that Donald Trump lost in California despite of winning US president election,. so I am interested in doing research demographics and geographical distribution of contributors/donors for each party and each candidate and find out the trends of the campaign, and at the end my research will be focused on two primarily rivals Donald Trump J. and Hillary Clinton.
